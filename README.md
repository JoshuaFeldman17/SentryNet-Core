# SentryNet-Core

**SentryNet-Core** is the main dashboard for the SentryNet system. It brings together data from all connected tools — drones, perimeter sensors, and more — into one clean interface.

This core dashboard aggregates and manages data from a variety of field units including:

- **Autonomous Patrol Drones**
- **Perimeter Fiber Detection Grids**
- **Thermal & Night Vision Surveillance Systems**
- **Mesh Communications Nodes**

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Live Map Interface**  
  Interactive, scalable “battlefield view” showing unit positions, patrol paths, alerts, and environmental data.

- **Threat Detection Feed**  
  AI-powered tagging and classification (e.g., human, vehicle, animal, unknown) with live notifications.

- **Sensor Fusion Engine**  
  Merges data from drones, fiber perimeters, and other sources for unified situational awareness.

- **Unit Control Panel**  
  Manual override and live telemetry monitoring of deployed SentryNet modules.

- **Alert & Response System**  
  Define threat levels, automated responses, and escalation protocols.

- **Data Logging & Review**  
  Store and replay incident timelines for intelligence, analysis, and training.

## 🔧 Technologies (Planned / Current)

- **Frontend**: React, Three.js (for 3D terrain/grid), TailwindCSS  
- **Backend**: Node.js / FastAPI, MQTT, WebSocket  
- **Comms**: ESP-NOW, LoRa, WiFi Mesh Integration  
- **AI**: OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite (Edge Inference)
